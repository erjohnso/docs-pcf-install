<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This guide describes how to install [Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) (PCF) on vSphere and vCloud Air.
It walks you through deploying the installation virtual machine known as Ops Manager, configuring your vSphere settings, and installing PCF Elastic Runtime.

If you experience a problem while following the steps below, refer to the [Known Issues](../pcf-release-notes/index.html) topics or to the [Pivotal Cloud Foundry Troubleshooting Guide](./troubleshooting.html).
Once you have completed the steps in this guide, explore the documentation on
[docs.pivotal.io](http://docs.pivotal.io) to learn more about [Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) (PCF)
and the Pivotal product suite.

<p class="note"><b>Note</b>: If you are performing an upgrade to PCF 1.7, see <a href="upgrading-pcf.html">Upgrading Pivotal Cloud Foundry</a> for critical upgrade information.</p>

## <a id='system'></a>Step 1: Confirm System Requirements ##

Before you begin your PCF deployment, ensure that your system meets the
minimum requirements.
The requirements include capacity for the virtual machines necessary for the
deployment, a supported version of the cf Command Line Interface (cf CLI) tool,
and certain user privileges.
Refer to the [Prerequisites to Deploying Operations Manager and Elastic Runtime](./requirements.html) topic for the complete list.

## <a id='deploy'></a>Step 2: Deploy PCF Ops Manager ##

1. Log in to [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io) and download the Ops
Manager virtual appliance file that matches your infrastructure.

1. Deploy Ops Manager using the procedure that corresponds to the VMware environment that you use:
   * <a href="./deploying-vm.html" class="subnav">Deploying Operations Manager to vSphere</a>
   * <a href="./pcf-vchs-vcloud.html" class="subnav">Deploying Operations Manager to vCloud Air and vCloud</a>

If you deploy Ops Manager to vSphere, review the topic about <a href="./disk-format.html" class="subnav">Provisioning a Virtual Disk in vSphere</a>.

## <a id='paas'></a>Step 3: Configure and Install PCF ##

**Goal**: Configure and install Ops Manager Director (included) and Elastic
Runtime.
Skip the import step for Elastic Runtime if you do not
want to import these products.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Ops Manager 1.7 security features require that you log in using a fully qualified domain name to access Ops Manager.</a></p>

1. Navigate to the fully qualified domain of your Ops Manager in a web browser.

1. The first time you start Ops Manager, you must choose one of the following:
    * <strong>[Use an Identity Provider](#idp)</strong>: If you use an Identity Provider, an external identity server maintains your user database.
    * <strong>[Internal Authentication](#internal)</strong>: If you use Internal Authentication, PCF maintains your user database.

<%= image_tag("select-authentication.png") %>

### <a id='idp'></a>Use an Identity Provider ###

<%= partial 'using_idp_ops_manager' %> 

### <a id='internal'></a>Internal Authentication ###

1. When redirected to the **Internal Authentication** page, you must complete the following steps:
    * Enter a **Username**, **Password**, and **Password confirmation** to create an Admin user.
    * Enter a **Decryption passphrase** and the **Decryption passphrase confirmation**. This passphrase encrypts the Ops Manager datastore, and is not recoverable.
    * If you are using an **Http proxy** or **Https proxy**, follow the [PCF Director Proxy Settings](./pcf-director-proxy-settings.html) instructions.
    * Read the **End User License Agreement**, and select the checkbox to accept the terms.

    <%= image_tag("om-login.png") %>

1. Log in to Ops Manager with the Admin username and password you created in the previous step.

### <a id='import-tiles'></a>Import Products ###

1. Download Elastic Runtime at [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io).
    * Elastic Runtime: Click the **Pivotal Cloud Foundry** banner to access the PCF product page. Use the drop-down menu to select an Elastic Runtime release.

1. From the Available Products view, click **Import a Product**.

    <%= image_tag("guide/import-prod.png") %>

1. Select the Elastic Runtime .pivotal file that you downloaded from Pivotal
Network and click **Open**.
After the import completes, Elastic Runtime appears in the Available Products
view.

1. In the Available Products view, hover over Elastic Runtime and click **Add**.

<%= image_tag("guide/add-products.png") %>

### <a id='configure-vmware'></a>Configure Ops Manager Director ###

Your Ops Manager download includes a tile for the version of Ops Manager
Director that corresponds to your IaaS.

1. (Optional) Use the Nexus 1000v Switch, follow the instructions in the <a href="./nexus-switch.html" class="subnav">Using the Cisco Nexus 1000v Switch with Ops Manager</a> topic.
2. Refer to one of the following topics for help configuring your Ops Manager
Director product tile:
  * <a href="./vsphere-config.html" class="subnav">Configuring Ops Manager Director for VMware vSphere</a>
  * <a href="./vchs-vcloud-config.html" class="subnav">Configuring Ops Manager Director for vCloud Air and vCloud</a>

If you plan to configure the Ops Manager Resurrector for increased availability of Elastic Runtime on vSphere or vCloud,
review the topic <a href="./resurrector.html" class="subnav">Using Ops Manager Resurrector on VMware vSphere</a>.

When configuring networks and availability zones for Ops Manager Director, you can refer to the <a href="./understand-az.html" class="subnav">Understanding Availability Zones in VMware Installations</a> topic.

### <a id='install-add-ons'></a> (Optional) Install the PCF IPsec Add-on ###

The PCF IPsec add-on secures network traffic within a Cloud Foundry deployment and provides internal system protection if a malicious actor breaches your firewall. See the [Securing Data in Transit with the IPsec Add-on](http://docs.pivotal.io/addon-ipsec/index.html) topic for installation instructions.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: You must install the PCF IPsec add-on before installing any other tiles to enable the IPsec functionality. Pivotal recommends installing IPsec immediately after Ops Manager, and before installing the Elastic Runtime tile.</p>

### <a id='configure-er'></a>Configure Elastic Runtime ###

See <a href="./config-er-vmware.html" class="subnav">Configuring Elastic Runtime for vSphere and vCloud Air</a>.

When configuring Elastic Runtime, you can refer to the <a href="../opsguide/ssl-term.html" class="subnav">Configuring SSL Termination for vSphere Deployments</a>
topic for details about specifying your the IP address for your load balancer.

### <a id='install'></a>Install Products ###

1. Click **Install**.

     <%= image_tag("guide/install.png") %>

1. Your updated PCF installation begins deploying.

     <%= image_tag("guide/deploy-progress.png") %>

1. When the deployment is finished, a success message appears.

     <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: On the recommended hardware
	infrastructure, deployment should take less than one hour and require no
	user intervention.</p>

You now have a fully functional installation of PCF.

## <a id='new-users'></a>Step 5: Create New User Accounts ##

Once you have successfully deployed PCF, add users to your account.
Refer to the [Creating New Elastic Runtime User Accounts](../opsguide/creating-account.html) topic for more information.

## <a id='target'></a>Step 6: Target Elastic Runtime ##

The next step is to use the cf CLI tool to target your Elastic Runtime
installation.
Make sure that you have [installed the cf CLI tool](../cf-cli/install-go-cli.html).
Refer to the PCF documentation for more information about [using the cf
command line tool](../cf-cli/getting-started.html).

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: In Pivotal Ops Manager, refer to
	<strong>Elastic Runtime > Credentials</strong> for the UAA admin name and
	password. You can also use the user that you created in Apps Manager, or
	create another user with the <code>create-user</code> command.</p>
