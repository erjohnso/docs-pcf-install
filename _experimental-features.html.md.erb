Use caution when enabling experimental features if you have other Pivotal Cloud Foundry service tiles installed in your Pivotal Cloud Foundry deployment. Not all of the services are guaranteed to work as expected with these features enabled.

### <a id="disk-memory-overcommit"></a>Diego Cell Memory and Disk Overcommit

If your apps do not use the full allocation of disk space and memory set in the **Resource Config** tab, you might want use this feature. These fields control the amount to overcommit disk and memory resources to each Diego Cell VM.

For example, you might want to use the overcommit if your apps use a small amount of disk and memory capacity compared with the **Resource Config** settings for **Diego Cell**.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Due to the risk of app failure and the deployment-specific nature of disk and memory use, Pivotal has no recommendation about how much, if any, memory or disk space to overcommit.</p>

To enable overcommit, follow these steps:

1. Select **Experimental Features**.

    <%= image_tag("./disk-memory-overcommit.png") %>

1. Enter the total desired amount of Diego cell memory value in the **Cell Memory Capacity (MB)** field. Refer to the **Diego Cell** row in the **Resource Config** tab for the current Cell memory capacity settings that this field overrides.

1. Enter the total desired amount of Diego cell disk capacity value in the **Cell Disk Capacity (MB)** field. Refer to the **Diego Cell** row in the **Resource Config** tab for the current Cell disk capacity settings that this field overrides.

1. Click **Save**.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Entries made to each of these two fields set the total amount of resources allocated, not the overage.</p>

### <a id="disable-priviledge"></a> Disable Privileged App Containers

By default, Pivotal Cloud Foundry deploys apps in privileged containers. Apps deployed to privileged containers can gain access to their host operating system. In general, Pivotal recommends disabling privileged containers by selecting this option.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Do not select <strong>Disable privileged app containers</strong> if you are running applications that use FUSE file system support. </p>

To disable privileged app containers, follow these steps:

1. Select **Experimental Features**.

    <%= image_tag("./disk-memory-overcommit.png") %>

1. Select **Disable privileged app containers**. This setting only applies to newly pushed apps, so you must restart any pre-existing apps to apply this option.

1. Click **Save**.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Containers based on Docker images are always unprivileged, regardless of this setting.</p>
